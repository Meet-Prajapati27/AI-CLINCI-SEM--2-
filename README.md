Analyzing Singer Voices with AI Through Music Streaming Platform 

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the application of machine learning in audio analysis has opened new frontiers in music technology. This project, conducted as part of the AI Clinic at Aivancity in collaboration with our partner company Alttrust SAS, explores the use of AI to analyze singersâ€™ vocal characteristics through music streaming platforms in order for them to learn lyrics faster. 
Our primary objective is to develop a system that can evaluate a variety of vocal features using dataset created by us manually and also publicly available audio data, such as pitch, timbre, and frequency range. In addition to providing personalized music recommendations and tools for vocal training, this system is equipped with advanced machine learning techniques.
As a part of the project, we also addressed critical challenges, such as data acquisition, feature extraction, model development, and ethical implications. By combining technical innovation with a strong ethical framework, this initiative seeks to contribute meaningfully to both academic research and real-world applications in the music industry.
